         Maid On Demand is India's only platform through which home owners can hire a domestic help online. The current $7 billion industry is highly unorganized and is plagued with non-professionals who not only take the home owners for a ride but also leave a very bad taste and name for the industry

This company is striving to change this forever. Home owners can now watch pre-recorded interviews online before meeting the help personally. Hence disrupting a space which has always been a very big problem in a country like India
